            <h1>The Toughest Mental Game</h1>
            <b>Why I Love Investing in Stocks</b>
            <p>
                The stock market has always represented more than just a stream of income to me - it was an area where most of my interests collided; economics, psychology, innovation, technology, and programming.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Just the mere ability to invest in some of the most generationally-defining companies is a gift I never wanted to pass up on. Though, oftentimes, it is looked down upon to actively invest in the market. We’re told to put a set amount of our income into index funds and forget it, and for the most part, I would agree. Trying to beat the market is <i>nearly impossible</i>. Just like every other profession though, it’s the constant practice and persistence that results in a profit.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as investing is about crunching the numbers, it is a mental game, and having confidence in a process designed for your risk profile and timeframe is a prerequisite. There is no substitute for hard work, and you must <i>love</i> the grind. For the past three years, I have spent countless time studying what makes a great investor, and how to find the next Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple before they go on to produce 100,000% returns. But even after spending full days consuming the investing content of mentors, writing several thousand lines of code for finance-related Python programs, and studying hundreds of my past trades, I know that I’ve just reached the tip of the iceberg, and that excites me tremendously.

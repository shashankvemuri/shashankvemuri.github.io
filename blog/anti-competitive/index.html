            <h1>Being Anti-Competitive</h1>
            <b>Focus on positive-sum games; become anti-competitive</b>
            <p>
                The idea of being anti-competitive is extremely meaningful to me, and I work towards fully making it my resting state every single day. Here's why:
            </p>
            <p>
                School, politics, and sports can sometimes mislead us into thinking that other people should serve as the barometer for our own progress, but in reality, all we have at the end of the day is our knowledge and what we choose to do with it. Leaning into my unique perspective and either using it to improve myself or help those around me has always been more rewarding than “outranking” others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important facets of life are where competition do not matter at all - love, wealth, health, and relationships are such examples. I've noticed that where you derive your motivation from in life is extremely important, and shifting mine from arbitrary comparisons to open-ended exploration has and will continue to improve the quality of my life.
